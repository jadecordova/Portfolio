    <p class="centered margin">Powered by <span class="green">FORTIS PAYMENT SYSTEMS</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Maridian Group</span> offers a variety of products and services to completely meet all of your processing needs. We have one of the most competitive pricing and highest-quality service programs in the payment processing industry. This includes authorization and processing services as well as on-line industry-specific solutions that will help your business save money and time.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In today’s economy, consumers are using less cash and checks and are using credit and debit cards as their choice of payment. When traveling for business or pleasure, eating at a favorite restaurant or entertaining clients, the use of credit cards continues to grow not only as a method of payment but as method of lifestyle. With these changes, merchants have been bombarded with the ever altering Visa/MC fees, rules and regulations. We know that in addition to managing these changes, merchants must also manage their businesses.</p>
    <p>At <span class="bold">Maridian Group</span>, we have designed a program that not only provide business owners with reduced fees on their credit card processing, but we bring industry experience and customer service beyond any of our competitors. In addition, our on-line services help our merchants to manage their everyday business more efficiently, ultimately lowering their overall costs and helping their bottom line moving forward!</p>
    <p>Feel free to send your statement over to us for a free, no obligation analysis. We will examine your current monthly processing statement and one of our friendly representatives will give you a confidential analysis of what you are currently paying and what <span class="bold">Maridian Group</span> can offer you in savings. Additionally we can make structural, processing and even payroll suggestions to make sure you are maximizing your profits.</p>

                <li><p>Accept both pin based and non-pin based debit cards. These both reduce the costs associated with processing in relation to accepting consumer credit cards. We can provide you with a pin pad to accept pin based debit at your terminal. In most cases this is the most cost effective and most secure type of transaction you can accept. Your pin pad can also be used through your terminal to provide ATM transaction to your customers! No need to purchase a separate ATM.</p></li>
