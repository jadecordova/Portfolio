                <p>I graduated in Visual Communications at the Andrés Bello Catholic University, in Caracas, Venezuela. Though I worked as a journalist for a few magazines, most of my career has been dedicated to graphic design and computer programming; mainly for the Web.</p>
                <p>I began this journey at Magic Slides, a multimedia event company, where I had the opportunity to learn what a Mac was. No, really. It was the 512K one, remember? Probably not. There, the design process was done by hand, creating a script and selecting photos from image banks to create presentations for a wide variety of events. It was the time when dinosaurs romaed the Earth, armed with those infamous brick cell phones.</p>
                <p>Then along came Criteria Screen, another event company, but by then, thank God, the Mac II already existed. And it was in C-O-L-O-R. Awesome. We produced digital slides on a Mac platform, and it was right there and then that I met Photoshop. It was version 1, I guess. And our love has only grew with time. It was also the golden age of Aldus, before it got swallowed up by Adobe. There was no Illustrator. There was FreeHand. There was no PowerPoint. There was Persuasion.</p>
                <p>After that, I was called to be part of the founding team for Etheron, the first Venezuelan ISP; part of the much larger 1BC Group, owner of newspapers, TV and radio stations. There I was in charge of designing and developing the company’s web portal. It was the birth of HTML. There was no fancy CSS. Just tables. And frames. And rotating gifs and &lt;blink&gt;-ing text. Remeber Netscape? Probably not.</p>
                <p>By the time I crossed the door at Visual Factory, arguably the most important design studio in Venezuela, the web had matured a bit. There was still no CSS in sight, but there was JavaScript. And Flash. Oh, Flash. So I became kind of a Flash-ActionScript guru, and designed and programmed Flash websites for the likes of Kellogg’s and Mitsubishi. Many, many banks too. </p>
                <p>Venezuela’s political environment, however, was starting to look grim. So the company decided to open a studio in Paris. And to Paris I went. It was called Fabriart. There I worked with plastic artist Carlos Cruz-Diez, programming his interactive pieces. We also did pieces for Jones Knowles Ritchie and PageUp, among others.</p>
                <p>And finally came to the U.S., where I’ve worked for Cuban Crafters maintaining their website, and mainly doing freelance stuff.</p>
                <p>So there you go. That’s a Brief History of My Time. And yeap. I like Physics too, so... I guess that makes me a complete nerd.</p>

                <p>Coding is my passion. It's what I like to do the most. I started with BASIC, a long time ago. From there, I did some exploring in Pascal, mainly out of curiosity.</p>
                <p>I fiddled a little bit with C, attempting to program simple games using DirectX.</p>
                <p>Then, I started working with Flash and ActionScript. I spend several years developing interactive Flash-based websites, applications, games and simulations. </p>
                <p>The C-style syntax of ActionScript flowed easily into JavaScript, and I've been developing in JS ever since. Currently I'm working on several personal proyects, includying a Electron video cataloger and a Phaser 3 RPG game.</p>
                <p>I also dabbled a little bit in C#, doing a dubbing/subtitling application.</p>
